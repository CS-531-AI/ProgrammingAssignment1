## Vacuum Cleaning Agent

This project was developed by students taking CS 531 (AI) at Oregon State University. In this assignment we designed and implemented 3 different vacuum-cleaning agents in two environments (view `report.pdf` for full description). Coded in Python3.

## Development 

Developed by: Christopher Mendez & Rupika Dikkala

## Instructions

Use `python main.py` (if that fails, try `python3 main.py`) to run the code. The output should result in two plots for the random agents and the stats tables included in the report.
