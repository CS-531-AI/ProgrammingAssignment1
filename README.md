# Vacuum Cleaning Agent

In this assignment we designed and implemented 3 different vacuum-cleaning agents in two environments (view `report.pdf` for the full description). This project is coded in Python3.

## Instructions

Use `python main.py` (if that fails, try `python3 main.py`) to run the code. The output should result in two plots for the random agents and the stats tables included in the report.
